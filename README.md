# Train-Scheduler

This is a project that I started during my time at the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. My original iteration wasn't up to the standards I wanted it to meet, so I started over with this new version that I plan on building to meet those standards. The final product will utilize Moment.js and connect to a Firebase database.
